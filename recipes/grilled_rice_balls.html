            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup short-grain sushi rice</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
                <li>1/4 cup butter, cut into small pieces</li>
                <li>Chopped chives, for garnish</li>
            </ul class="ingredients">
            <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol class="directions">
                <li>For this recipe it's important that you use Japanese short-grain white rice, also sometimes called
                    sushi rice. Brown rice and long-grain rice will not work. Cook the rice according to the package
                    directions along with the salt. While the rice is cooking bring the soy sauce and mirin to a boil
                    over low heat until it's reduced by about half. Take it off the heat and whisk in the butter.</li>
                <li>When the rice is done and cooled down just a bit (it should still be hot), cut off a square piece
                    of plastic wrap and pile 1/4 of the cooked rice in the center. Wrap the plastic around it and use
                    your hands to press it together into 1-inch thick triangle. Make sure they are densely packed
                    together so they won't fall apart on the grill. Repeat with the remaining rice and plastic wrap.</li>
                <li>Preheat the grill to medium.</li>
                <li>Use a pastry brush to baste 1 side of the rice balls with the butter mixture and put them on the
                    grill, buttered side down. Let them grill until browned and crisp on 1 side, about 5 minutes) then
                    brush the tops of the rice balls with the butter mixture. Flip them over using tongs and grill
                    until the second side is crisp. Transfer the rice balls to a serving platter. Brush again with
                    the butter mixture and garnish with chives.</li>
